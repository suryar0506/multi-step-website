I especially like doing scenes from the Hindu Culture.After sketching the drawing with a pencil,I then, proceed to outline it with a black marker,or pen. Finally, I color the drawing with a oil pastel, or water color. Recently,I've also used color pencil. In the near future, I will use acrylic paint. When drawing, one <b>must</b> pay close attention to detail.If one draws sincerely, then automatically,the person will focus pinpointedly.Without focus,patience,and detailed observation,drawing will be a mystery,none can solve.But when I draw sincerely, all thought but the ones about the drawing itself, are removed.I am 12 years old, and study in 7th grade.";
